                <p>PhySoc offers a lot to our students but this wouldn't be possible without the support we receive from industry. In return, companies gain access to over 1000 active physics students through a variety of events, sessions, emails, job advertisements and more.</p>

                <p>We only hold events for speakers or companies who support us directly and we always welcome new partnerships and opportunities.</p>
