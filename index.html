			<h1>QUANG NGUYEN</h1>

			<p>Hi, I'm Quang. I'm somewhere in my twenties and I love writing programmes. The sorts of programmes that I particularly love are those that bring smiles and WOW people around me.</p>

			<p>What is it in programming that I actually enjoy? The challenge and rewards and dealing with contraints. For instance, I once programmed every machine code from scratch to do loads of things (graphics, game physics, animation and sound) on a microcontroller in order to play... Flappy Bird on the oscilloscope. Mad as it seems and as complicated as it could get, seeing the fun that people get when playing the game is one of the best things I ever had in my life.</p>

			<p>Programming gives me power to make changes to the world (my ambition of course). In 2016, I constructed a statistical model for the Pacific tropical cyclones, helping governments to assess the risks of these natural disasters. Hundreds of cyclones were analysed using Python and pandas in an unprecedented effort to be the first to publish the distribution of regional cyclones. Today, I am continuing to work with researchers at Imperial College Atmospheric Physics to refine the statistical model and integrate the results with a numerical model.</p>

			<p>As much as I love programmming, I love collaborating on programming project. Send me a message and let's work together to make changes to the world. One programme at a time.</p>
