	<p>Hi, I am Quang Nguyen. I was born and raised in Hanoi, Vietnam but has become an international citizen since 2008.</p>

	<p>I am curious about all things. I love exploring and learning new things everyday. In the pursuit of knowledge, I enrolled myself in Imperial College London in 2014. I have been studying Physics there since.</p>

	<p>I am half idealist, half realist. For that matter, I love putting the knowledge I have to great use. I have always like to tinker with electronics and machines.</p>

	<p>One of the main problems with my ephemeral mind is that I easily lose track of my progress on all things. This is why this blog was created. Firstly, it is for me to keep track of my projects. Secondly, it is to garner feedback from everyone. Last but not least, it is to share my experience with everyone worldwide.</p>

	<p>Welcome to my blog. I appreciate your readership, comments and feedback. Contact me if you have any query.</p>
